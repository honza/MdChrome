MdChrome
========

MdChrome is a Chrome extension that allows you to preview the HTML version of a
Markdown document. Anytime you view a file with a markdown file extension,
MdChrome will parse it and display a pretty version of it (with basic CSS).

You can double click the `MdChrome.crx` file to install a compressed version.

MdChrome uses [markdown-js][1] to do the Markdown rendering.
